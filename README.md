    Coroutine is a kind of non preemptive thread in user space, which is mainly used to 
    solve the problem of waiting for a large number of IO operations; coroutine project 
    mainly uses the coroutine to realize the jump between two functions and main function,
    and releases the memory automatically by the function to give up the CPU occupation, 
    so as to realize the context preservation and restoration.

    1）main.c
    The main.c function mainly implements two func and the main function call.
    
    2)ctx.c
    ctx.c function is mainly used to implement the internal implementation of coprogram, 
    including function body encapsulation / creation, function storage and CPU recovery.
    
    3)ctx.h
    CTX.h is the header file call of the coroutine.
    
    4)Makefile
    The function of makefile file is to compile the file used by the connection command nmake on the command line.
    
    5）a.out
    This file is automatically generated after running the make command.
    
### ATTENTION：Before executing make each time, "make clean" should be executed to clear the intermediate files and results left by the last compilation, and then recompile.
    
    $ make        #compile
    $ ./a.out      #run
